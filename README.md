# Linear Algebra

This is a small utility that would allow doing linear algebra
on arbitrary fields. The current library supports, finite fields,
the field of rational numbers and the field of real numbers (of course with
computational imprecision). We would include the field of 
complex numbers as well. A new field can be easily implemented.
